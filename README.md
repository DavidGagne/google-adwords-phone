## from Google:
If you'd like to make sure it's working, you can do a search that brings up your ad, then click the ad to visit your website (you'll be charged for the click). Your regular phone number should now be replaced with a Google forwarding number.

If you're doing repeated tests, delete the "gwcm" cookie from your browser before clicking on an ad again.
